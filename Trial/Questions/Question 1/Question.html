 <h3>
     A large number of bacteria are suspended in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.
     <br/>Out of these, around 10 - 20 have the ability to grow on plates containing Ampicillin.
     <br/>The maximum volume which can be used to spread on a plate is around 150 &mu;L.
     <br/>What is a way to quickly concentrate the bacteria in the smaller volume?
