# PravegaHex
Hex Game for Pravega Biology

Needs Scala to run. I use version 2.11.8. Also needs JDK 8u40 or higher.

Download the `Hexquiz.jar` from the [releases page](https://github.com/tamchow/PravegaHex/releases)
Run via command shell as:

    scala HexQuiz.jar
    
The current working directory needs to have `/Trial/Questions/` folder structure within which individual questions are located.
 See [./Trial/Readme.txt](https://github.com/tamchow/PravegaHex/blob/final/Trial/Readme.txt) for more details.
